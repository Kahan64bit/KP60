## 🔭 Roadmap ✨

The KP60 project is actively evolving to support a broader range of features for keyboard customizers and enthusiasts. Here's a sneak peek at what’s coming in future versions:

### 🛠 Planned Features

- 🌈 **Per-key RGB Lighting Support**  
  Add WS2812/Addressable RGB support for underglow and per-key effects.

- 🖥️ **OLED Screen Integration**  
  Support for a 128x32 OLED screen for displaying layers, animations, or custom text.

- 🔌 **Hot-Swap Socket Support**  
  Enable easy switch swapping without soldering.

- 🎛️ **Rotary Encoder Support**  
  Optional encoder support for volume, media, and custom actions.

### 📦 Hardware Iteration Plans

- **KP60 v0.2** — Minor optimizations, ESD tuning, silkscreen updates  
- **KP60 v0.3** — Major revision with RGB, OLED, encoder footprints, and hot-swap support
